##Comment on Merge branch 'main'
I was about to commit 'Spaceship accelerates', when I noticed a bad naming mistake in 'Spaceship can now turn right'. Not very experienced with git I failed to commit --amend so I stashed everything  did rebase -i HEAD^ and then popped stash. I wanted to recreate the failed commit with removing the code for a future commit, which was not a good idea. So you will also see some future code in 'Spaceship can now turn right'
